# Rubik's Cube Solver

_Nicholas Neumann-Chun and Alec Greaves-Tunnell_

_7 Dec 2011, Williams College, CS 134_

### Nicholas was a junior math major taking his first CS class. His professor realized that Nicholas was really interested in computer graphics. Professor McGuire gave him the resources, guidance, and confidence needed to build a 3D rasterization engine from scratch in Java. It's kind of amazing that it worked.

### Together, Alec and Nicholas used this 3D engine to display a self-solving 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube. Again, it should be emphasized that this was the final project for their *intro* CS class. Pretty neat.

*It has been a while since I made this. You can take a look at the source code, but I cringe at bit at how WET it is. If you want to run it, download the `jar-files` folder and then run `solver.jar`.*
