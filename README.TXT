PROJECT TITLE: Itty-Bitty Rubikâ€™s Cube

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: render and solve a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube

DATE: December 7, 2011

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: create an instance of RubiksCubeUI, or, for
    faster rendering, compile a .jar file (highly recommended)

AUTHORS: Alec Greaves-Tunnell and Nicholas Neumann-Chun

USER INSTRUCTIONS: click "scramble", then "solve", or just play with it
    yourself using the buttons at the bottom of the window
    
    
    there will be an immediate visual reaction to any control that you
    adjust, except possibly:
    
    the "speed" slider: this controls how fast the animations are displayed
    the "reset" button: this resets the cube to its initial solved state
